## üåã Floods

### 1. Introduction/Definition
A **flood** is defined as a rise in the water level of a river, stream, or coastal area, leading to the inundation of land that is normally dry. This overflow of water can cause significant damage to property, infrastructure, and agricultural land, forcing people to relocate to safer areas.

### 2. Causes of Floods

**Natural Causes:**
* **Heavy Rainfall:** Prolonged and intense rainfall is the most common cause, leading to rivers and streams overflowing their banks.
* **Snowmelt:** Rapid melting of snow and ice in mountainous regions can cause a sudden surge in water volume in rivers.
* **Storm Surges:** In coastal areas, cyclones and tsunamis can cause a significant rise in sea level, leading to coastal flooding.
* **Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs):** The sudden release of water from a glacial lake.
* **Cloudbursts:** Extremely heavy rainfall in a localized area over a short period.

**Anthropogenic (Man-made) Causes:**
* **Deforestation:** The removal of trees reduces the soil's capacity to absorb water, increasing surface runoff.
* **Dam Failure:** Poorly constructed or maintained dams can break, releasing a massive volume of water downstream.
* **Unplanned Urbanization:** The construction of buildings, roads, and other non-porous surfaces in urban areas reduces the land's ability to absorb rainwater, leading to urban floods.
* **Inadequate Drainage:** Poorly designed or clogged drainage systems in urban areas cannot handle excess rainwater effectively.
* **Land Use Changes:** Altering natural landscapes for agriculture or construction can disrupt natural drainage patterns.

### 3. Types of Floods
* **Flash Floods:** These occur suddenly with little to no warning, usually due to intense rainfall from a thunderstorm or a dam/levee failure.
* **Riverine Floods:** Occur when a river or stream overflows its banks, often caused by prolonged rainfall or rapid snowmelt.
* **Coastal Floods:** Occur when strong onshore winds from cyclones, hurricanes, or tsunamis push seawater onto the land.
* **Urban Floods:** Happen in developed areas where drainage infrastructure is overwhelmed by heavy rainfall.

### 4. Impacts and Consequences
* **Primary Effects (Direct):**
    * Loss of life and injuries to people and livestock.
    * Damage to buildings, homes, infrastructure (roads, bridges, power lines).
    * Destruction of crops and agricultural land.
* **Secondary Effects (Short-term):**
    * Contamination of water supplies, leading to outbreaks of waterborne diseases.
    * Disruption of essential services like electricity, transportation, and communication.
    * Displacement of communities.
* **Tertiary Effects (Long-term):**
    * Significant economic losses due to rebuilding costs and disruption to industries.
    * Psychological trauma and stress for affected populations (PTSD).
    * Environmental degradation, including soil erosion and loss of biodiversity.

### 5. Disaster Management and Mitigation Strategies
**Pre-Disaster (Preparedness & Mitigation):**
* **Structural Measures:** Construction of **dams, reservoirs, and embankments**; improving **drainage systems**; **flood proofing** of buildings.
* **Non-Structural Measures:** **Flood plain zoning**; developing **early warning systems**; public awareness campaigns; preparing emergency kits.

**During-Disaster (Response):**
* **Evacuation:** Moving people from high-risk areas to designated safe shelters.
* **Search and Rescue (SAR):** Deploying trained teams to rescue trapped individuals.
* **Immediate Relief:** Providing essential supplies such as food, water, shelter, and medical assistance.

**Post-Disaster (Recovery & Rehabilitation):**
* **Damage Assessment:** Conducting surveys to determine the extent of the damage.
* **Reconstruction:** Repairing and rebuilding with a "Build Back Better" (BBB) approach.
* **Financial Assistance:** Providing grants or loans to help people rebuild their lives.
* **Psycho-social Support:** Offering counseling and mental health services.

## üåã Volcanoes

### 1. Introduction/Definition
A **volcano** is an opening in the Earth's crust through which molten rock (magma), hot gases, and ash can escape from the planet's interior.

### 2. Causes of Volcanoes
Volcanic eruptions are primarily caused by the movement of **tectonic plates**.
* **Convergent Plate Boundaries:** One plate subducts under another, melts, and the resulting magma rises to the surface.
* **Divergent Plate Boundaries:** Plates pull apart, and magma rises to fill the gap.
* **Hotspots:** Plumes of hot mantle material rise and melt through the crust.

### 3. Types/Classification of Volcanoes
* **Shield Volcanoes:** Large, broad volcanoes with gentle slopes, formed by fluid lava flows.
* **Composite Volcanoes (Stratovolcanoes):** Steep-sided, conical volcanoes known for explosive eruptions.
* **Cinder Cone Volcanoes:** The simplest type, built from ejected lava fragments.

Volcanoes are also classified by activity: **Active**, **Dormant**, or **Extinct**.

### 4. Impacts and Consequences
* **Primary Effects (Direct):** Destruction from **lava flows**, **pyroclastic flows**, and falling **ash and volcanic bombs**.
* **Secondary Effects (Short-term):** **Lahars (volcanic mudflows)**, **acid rain**, and disruption of air travel.
* **Tertiary Effects (Long-term):** Changes in global weather patterns and the creation of fertile soil.

### 5. Disaster Management and Mitigation Strategies
**Pre-Disaster (Preparedness & Mitigation):**
* **Structural Measures:** Constructing barriers to divert lava flows; reinforcing buildings.
* **Non-Structural Measures:** **Volcanic Hazard Mapping**; **monitoring and early warning systems**; developing evacuation plans.

**During-Disaster (Response):**
* Timely **evacuation** based on warnings.
* Providing clear **communication** and updates to the public.
* Advising health precautions (e.g., wearing masks).

**Post-Disaster (Recovery & Rehabilitation):**
* **Damage assessment** and clean-up operations.
* **Health support** for respiratory issues.
* **Long-term monitoring** of the volcano.

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Landslides

### 1. Introduction/Definition
A **landslide** is the movement of rock, debris, or earth down a sloped section of land under the direct influence of gravity.

### 2. Causes of Landslides

**Natural Causes:**
* **Heavy Rainfall or Snowmelt:** Water saturation reduces friction in soil and rock.
* **Earthquakes:** Ground shaking can dislodge large masses of earth.
* **Volcanic Eruptions:** Vibrations and loose ash deposits can trigger slides.
* **Erosion:** Undercutting of slopes by rivers or waves.

**Anthropogenic (Man-made) Causes:**
* **Deforestation:** Removing vegetation weakens slope stability.
* **Construction and Excavation:** Cutting into slopes for roads or buildings.
* **Improper Drainage:** Water saturation from leaking pipes or poor management.

### 3. Types/Classification of Landslides
* **Falls:** Abrupt movement of rocks from steep slopes.
* **Topples:** Forward rotation of rock or soil.
* **Slides:** Movement along a surface (can be rotational or translational).
* **Flows:** Movement of water-saturated material like a fluid (debris flows, mudflows).
* **Spreads:** Lateral movement on gentle slopes, often due to soil liquefaction.
* **Creep:** Very slow, steady, downward movement.

### 4. Impacts and Consequences
* **Primary Effects (Direct):** Loss of life, destruction of homes and infrastructure, blockage of roads and rivers.
* **Secondary Effects (Short-term):** Disruption of transport networks, loss of agricultural land.
* **Tertiary Effects (Long-term):** High economic costs for clean-up, permanent landscape changes.

### 5. Disaster Management and Mitigation Strategies
**Pre-Disaster (Preparedness & Mitigation):**
* **Structural Measures:** Construction of **retaining walls** and **gabions**; **slope stabilization** techniques.
* **Non-Structural Measures:** **Hazard Zonation Mapping**; **early warning systems**; **afforestation** to bind soil.

**During-Disaster (Response):**
* **Evacuation** of threatened areas.
* **Search and Rescue** for trapped individuals.
* **Clearing debris** from critical infrastructure.

**Post-Disaster (Recovery & Rehabilitation):**
* **Damage assessment** and potential **relocation** of communities.
* **Reconstruction** with improved engineering.
* **Geotechnical investigation** to prevent future slides.
